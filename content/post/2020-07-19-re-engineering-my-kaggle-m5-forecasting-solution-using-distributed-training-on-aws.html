<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I recently participated in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy">M5 Forecasting - Accuracy</a> Kaggle competition to forecast daily sales for over 30,000 WalMart products. My best solution, which was a bottom-level design that modeled each product in isolation, placed in the top 28%. I was initially pleased with this outcome considering it was my first major competition, but I wasn’t entirely satisfied, especially since my methodology was not too different from the top performers. I’ve decided to take a stab at re-engineering my solution to see if I can improve my rank.</p>
</div>
<div id="recap-of-original-solution" class="section level2">
<h2>Recap of original solution</h2>
<p>My original solution was a pure bottom-level design that fit a unique Random Forest model to each unique product, resulting in over 30,000 models. The entire model pipeline (feature engineering, training, inference) was done in-memory on a 48-core AWS EC2 instance. The total runtime was less than 2 hours using parallel processing. The final score of 0.769 placed in the top 28%.</p>
<p>The strengths of this design include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relatively lightweight since each product was handled in isolation and the amount of data for an individual product was quite small on average (e.g. 1500 rows, 170 columns).</li>
<li>Completed entirely in-memory using parallel processing.</li>
<li>Relatively fast (&lt; 2 hours)</li>
<li>Relatively accurate</li>
</ul>
<p>There were some weaknesses, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ignored some categorical features. Based on my analysis of the top performer’s results, the main difference in my feature engineering pipeline was the exclusion of a handful of categorical features including item ID, category ID, department ID, store ID, and state ID.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignored interactions and correlations between products. For example, if product A and product B are in the same category and product A goes on sale, then sales for product A will likely increase AND sales for product B will likely decrease. My original bottom-level solution was incapable of learning these dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p>Insufficient resources to do large-scale training. For example, if all products were merged into a single data set, the total size would be <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> 17.6GB, making it significantly more challenging to train in-memory on a single machine using R.</p></li>
<li><p>The choice to use Random Forests was a departure from the use of GBMs by the top performers. Perhaps a Random Forest could be tuned to perform better, but the impressive performance of GBMs (LightGBM in particular) is good reason to follow suit.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-new-solution" class="section level2">
<h2>The new solution</h2>
<p>My new solution addresses the aforementioned weaknesses. It has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Incorporates categorical features (item ID, category ID, department ID, store ID, and state ID) in the training data using label encoding.</p></li>
<li><p>Large-scale, distributed training using AWS SageMaker with multiple EC2 instances and data distributed in S3.</p></li>
<li><p>SageMaker XGBoost algorithm</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="some-initial-compromises" class="section level3">
<h3>Some initial compromises</h3>
<p>In a perfect world, I would leverage k-fold cross validation and hyperparameter tuning to reach the final model. In this context, however, I decided to do neither. The main reason is because both steps would be significantly time and resource consuming, including costs for using AWS services. To keep my costs down, I ignored these two steps and instead relied on the collective knowledge of the Kaggle competition participants to formulate a sound training strategy. For example, instead of hyperparameter tuning I used many of the same hyperparameter values that were used by the top performers. I also consulted the XGBoost docs to learn about setting hyperparameter values to minimize the risk of overfitting. Regarding cross validation, many of the participants felt the final evaluation data was not well represented by the training data. Thus, there is an argument to be made against the use of cross validation in this competition.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-data-into-s3" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting data into S3</h3>
<p>To enable distributed training using AWS SageMaker, I needed to get my training data into S3. To do this, I did the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch a c5.24xlarge EC2 instance (96 cores, 192GB memory) using the <a href="https://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/">RStudio AMI</a></li>
<li>Store raw competition data on-disk</li>
<li>Engineer features for each product using parallel processing</li>
<li>Upload clean training data and competition evaluation data for each individual product to S3, resulting in 30,000+ CSV files</li>
</ul>
<p>The main goal is to get clean training data into S3. Fortunately, the full training data does not have to be stored in a single file. Instead, it can be distributed across multiple files. This means I can process and upload product-level data to s3 using parallel processing without overloading the local EC2 instance. By “sharding” the training data, AWS SageMaker allows for distributed training by loading a subset of the files to each instance in the cluster. For example, in a cluster of 15 EC2 instance each instance receives approximately 1/15th of the total training data.</p>
<p>Note: The SageMaker XGBoost requires no header row (i.e. column names), so be sure to remove these from the data before uploading to S3.</p>

<h3>Launching the training job</h3>
<p>I opened a ml.t2.xlarge SageMaker Notebook instance to launch my training job and used <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/advanced_functionality/data_distribution_types/data_distribution_types.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a> as a reference.</p>
<p>Some of the key features of the training job include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cluster of 15 ml.m4.4xlarge instances for distributed training</li>
<li><code>S3DataDistributionType</code> parameter set to “ShardedByS3Key”</li>
<li>XGBoost hyperparameters
<ul>
<li>num_round = 3000</li>
<li>eta = 0.1</li>
<li>objective = “reg:tweedie”</li>
<li>tweedie_variance_power = 1.5</li>
<li>eval_metric = “rmse”</li>
<li>rate_drop = 0.2</li>
<li>min_child_weight = 7</li>
<li>max_depth = 5</li>
<li>colsample_bytree = 0.7</li>
<li>subsample = 0.7</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The complete Python script for launching the training job looks like this:</p>
