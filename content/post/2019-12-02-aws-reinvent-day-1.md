Today marks the first day of AWS re:Invent 2019. I am excited to deepen and document my expertise with machine learning on AWS. 

My general goals for re:Invent are the following:

- Improve my understanding of serverless services (e.g. Lambda, S3, Glue, API Gateway, Kinesis, Athena) and how they can be used to build and monitor robust machine learning pipelines. I'd like to build and document 1-3 sample pipelines for reference.

- Improve my understanding of managed services for ML/AI, including SageMaker and EMR, to enable rapid data science development with minimal concern for infrastructure. I'd like to train, tune, and deploy at least 2 models using either Spark, Scikit-learn, or R.
