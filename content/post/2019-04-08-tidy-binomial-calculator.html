<p>This short post introduces a simple R package called <code>probs</code> that I created for tidy binomial probability calculations. In the future, <code>probs</code> will include similar functions for calculating probability assuming different probability distributions.</p>
<div id="install" class="section level1">
<h1>Install</h1>
<p>The <code>probs</code> package lives on GitHub.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(devtools)

devtools::install_github(&quot;dannymorris/probs&quot;)</code></pre>

<h1>Simulated Data</h1>
<p>Recently, I needed to communicate to a larger audience the probability of detecting a particular event. Specifically, a pre-existing process was in place that required humans to sift through a sample of 100 PDF documents out of 40,000 documents. The intent of this process was determine whether or not the entire batch of documents was faulty or passable.</p>
<p>Based on previous data, there was reason to believe that a batch of 40,000 documents <em>may</em> contain 50 faulty documents. So the humans would manually inspect a sample of 100 documents, hoping to find at least 1 faulty document.</p>
<p>I created the <code>probs</code> package to quickly determine the probability of detecting 1 or more faulty documents in a sample of 100, given that the batch of 40,000 documents may contain 50 faulty documents.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># probability of detecting a single faulty document in a batch of 40,000 documents, assuming there are 50 faulty documents in total.
prob_faulty &lt;- 50/40000

paste(&quot;The probability that any randomly selected document is faulty is&quot;, prob_faulty)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;The probability that any randomly selected document is faulty is 0.00125&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In other words, the probability of detecting a single faulty document in this case is .00125.</p>
<p>The question is now <strong>what is the probability that no faulty documents will be found in a sample of 100 documents, assuming there are 50 faulty documents in a batch of 40,000?</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(probs)

probs::cumul_binom_prob(
  n_success = 0,
  prob_success = prob_faulty,
  sample_size = 100
)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## $results
## # A tibble: 1 x 5
##   lower_tail upper_tail n_success prob_success sample_size
##        &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1      0.882      0.118         0      0.00125         100
## 
## $explanation
## [1] &quot;The probability of 0 or fewer successes is 0.8824&quot; 
## [2] &quot;The probability of more than 0 successes is 0.1176&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The printout from the function explains that .88 is the probability that someone would find 0 faulty documents in a sample of 100. In other words, the humans are wasting their time if they are expecting to discover even a single faulty document.</p>
