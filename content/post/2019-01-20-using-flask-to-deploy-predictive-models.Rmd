This document describes an approach to developing a Flask app and deploying locally.

# Environment

- Windows 10
- Anaconda version 2018.12 (includes conda)

# Create and activate conda environment in Anaconda Prompt

Before I begin with building the Flask app, I'll create a conda environment to house the dependencies needed to run the app. A conda environment is simply an isolated directory that contains a specific collection of conda packages needed for the job. Python and Flask are the dependencies needed to run this particular app.

**Open Anaconda Prompt** and enter the following commands to create and activate a new conda environment.

```
conda create -n flask-app
conda activate flask-app
```

By activating the environment named "flask-app", we enable package installation to the environment.

# Install dependencies

While in Anaconda Prompt, make sure the conda environment is activated. Enter this command to install the necessary dependencies to build and deploy the Flask app.

```
conda install python==3.6
```

Run `conda list` to see a list of dependencies installed in the conda environment. Here I am installing Python 3.6, though other versions can be specified as well.

# Very simple Flask app

Now that the conda environment is created and activated and the dependencies are installed, I can start building the Flask app. Open a text editor (e.g. Notepad++, Spyder, etc.) and create a Python script called `app.py` containing the following Python code.

```
# app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello world!\n'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

# Run the app

Open Anaconda Prompt and make sure the conda environment is activated, then change directory to the folder where `app.py` was saved. For example, if `app.py` was saved in `C:\Users\Owner\Documents\flask-project`, your command in Anaconda Prompt may look like this.

```
cd Documents/flask-project
```

Once the new directory has been set, I can deploy the app using the following code.

```
python app.py
```

If done correctly, the print out in Anaconda Prompt should look like this.

# Test the app

To test if the app is working as expected, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should a message that reads "Hello world!" on the page.

# Next steps

In another article I'll look deploying a machine learning built using scikit-learn.
