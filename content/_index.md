# Abnormal Distributions

This is the homepage and blog of Danny Morris. I currently work in the health insurance industry as a marketing analytics consultant for HealthNow New York, Inc. My interests include R programming, exploratory data mining, machine learning.

My site has two primary goals:

1. To **document my work**

2. To **document my experiences** with data science techniques and technologies that impact my work and may do the same for others
