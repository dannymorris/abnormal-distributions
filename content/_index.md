This is the homepage and personal website of Danny Morris. I am a Data Scientist specializing in forecasting, machine learning, and solution engineering. My main tools are R, Python, and AWS. I love learning more than anything, so I launched this site is to document my methodologies. I also love helping others, so I hope you find this content useful and inspiring.

This site is built with [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
