# Abnormal Distributions

My name is Danny Morris and welcome to my personal website. I use this site to share information with the data science community on topics related to my professional experiences and personal interests. I am an R enthusiast and I'm always searching for new things to learn. If you come across these pages, my hope is that you find something useful.

This site is built with [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
