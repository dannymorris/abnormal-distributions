# Abnormal Distributions

This is the homepage and personal website of Danny Morris. I am a Data Scientist focused on building practical, testable, and reproducible models to deliver business solutions and answer questions. I love writing tidy R code (Python is just okay), and I love writing about interesting things that I'm learning. 

This site is built with [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
