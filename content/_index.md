# Abnormal Distributions

This is the homepage and blog of Danny Morris. I currently work in the health insurance industry as a marketing analytics consultant for HealthNow New York, Inc. I've been using the R language for about 5 years and I am very enthusiastic user of the language. My other main interests include exploratory data mining, machine learning, and visualization. I've recently been exploring other data science technologies, including Python and SQL Server Machine Learning Services, to broaden my perspective. I became a data scientist the unconventional way. I don't have an advanced degree in mathematics or computer science. I learned a fair amount of statistics and R programming during my undergraduate years, but afterwards I continued to invest my time in learning the skills and technologies that I was passion about. Early on, that mainly involved principal components analysis, clustering, and visualization with ggplot2. Through my work, I began to apply the things I was learning and eventually developed some expertise in a few new subjects such as data engineering, machine learning, and writing good documentation. These days, I get a lot of joy out of helping new R users find their way with R and data science.

My website has two primary goals:

1. To **document examples of my work.**

2. To **document my experiences** with data science techniques and technologies that impact my work and may do the same for others.
