# Abnormal Distributions

This is a personal website created by Danny Morris using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). I have two goals for this website:

1. To document some of the more interesting tools and techniques that I have learned in my career as a Data Scientist.

2. To develop connections with others who share a similar passion for data analysis. Hopefully the content on this site will be useful to others. 

Please feel free to connect with me!
