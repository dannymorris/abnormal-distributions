# Abnormal Distributions

This is the homepage and personal website of Danny Morris, a Data Scientist at HealthNow NY in Buffalo, NY. I built this site to document interesting or relevant techniques related to data science and machine learning for future reference.

This site is built with [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
