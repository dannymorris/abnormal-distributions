# Abnormal Distributions

My name is Danny Morris and welcome to my personal website. Though I have built a successful career as a Data Scientist, my focus moving forward is on analytics leadership. I enjoy learning, teaching, and writing, so I launched this site as a form of documentation. If you come across these pages, my hope is that you find something useful.

This site is built with [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drmorris87/), send me an [email](mailto:drmorris87@outlook.com), or visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/dannymorris).
