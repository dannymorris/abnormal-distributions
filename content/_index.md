# Abnormal Distributions

This is the homepage and personal website of Danny Morris. I am a Data Scientist focused on building practical, testable, and scalable predictive and statistical models. The purpose of my site is to document some modeling strategies that I believe to be highly effective towards building valid, high quality models. I really enjoy writing tidy R code, so much of this documentation is written in R. 

This site is built with [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
