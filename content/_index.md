# Abnormal Distributions

This is a personal website created by Danny Morris using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for the purpose of documenting some of the open source tools and techniques I use for data science. In my work, I use a combination of open source and commercial tools though I prefer open source due to accessibility and cost. I enjoy doing a little bit of everything including data engineering, exploratory analysis, machine learning, and presentation/documenation. R has been my primary tool for several years, but I've been delving into tools such as Python and Docker. My hope is that others and my future self will benefit from this documentation.
