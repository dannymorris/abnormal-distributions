I work for HealthNow NY, a health insurance company in upstate New York serving nearly 500,000 members. Broadly speaking, I have two main areas of focus. I provide advanced analytical support to the Marketing team and its partners, and I serve in a leadership role in infusing data science into the organization.

My mission is to help individuals and teams obtain deeper insights from their data. I work mostly with exploratory data mining and predictive modeling. Exploratory data mining is the process of applying statistical modeling to data in order to learn valuable yet deeply embedded characteristics of the data. Recently I taught a training class on how to detect outliers in data using exploratory data mining techniques. Predictive modeling, on the other hand, seeks to automate or supplement decision making using computer algorithms capable of learning processes with great precision. Recently I've been using predictive models to extract and categorize meaningful information from large bodies of text (e.g. PDFs).

In terms of technical preferences, my main tool is R. For exploratory data mining, R is a highly expressive and performant language thanks to the `tidyverse` library and high-performance libraries like `Rcpp`. Tools within the R ecosystem I frequenly use include the `tidyverse`, `caret`, `htmlwidgets`, `DBI`, `text2vec`, `rmarkdown`, and `shiny`. These tools cover the majority of my work in programming, data visualization, data analysis, predictive modeling, and presentation. I also really enjoy writing R packages and developing R software.

Other tools I utilize for specific cases include SQL Server, Python, and AWS.
