Hello! Currently, I am a Data Scientist for HealthNow NY, a health insurance company in upstate New York serving nearly 500,000 customers. My main job is to provide analytical support to the Marketing team, which by association also involves Sales and Communications. My focus is on helping them understand their data, measuring campaign success, and automating complex and time-consuming processes. I do a lot of data mining, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling in my pursuit to develop intelligent business solutions. My main tool is R, but depending on the solution I utilize tools such as Alteryx, SQL, and Python.

On a secondary basis, I also support the growth of the company's analytical community by developing and delivering advanced analytical trainings, dedicating time for one-on-one project consultations, and developing software that enhances or simplifies the data analysis workflow. 

I have a lot of experience exploring data and discovering insights using advanced analytical techniques, but more recently I've been researching practical ways to deploy machine learning models written in R and Python to cloud and on-premise servers. For on-premise deployments, SQL Server Machine Learning Services has become very popular during the POC stage since most of our analytical workflows flow through SQL Server databases. For cloud deployments, AWS Lambda is proving to be cost-friendly and relatively straightforward.

On a personal note, I really enjoy writing R code and developing R software including packages, Shiny applications, and R Markdown documents for reproducible research. I believe the R language is the most expressive language for data science.
