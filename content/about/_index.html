<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I am a versatile and experienced data scientist who, above all else, excels at data mining and predictive analytics for the purpose of helping functional business areas leverage new ways of conducting business.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In 2017, I created and executed a new way to predict Medicare Star measure thresholds using a blend of linear regression, ARIMA forecasting, and hierarchical clustering. This model supported data-driven planning and contributed to $30M in revenue thanks to a 40% improvement in accuracy over the previous methodology.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2019, I created and launched a new data science product to my organization called SimText that automatically audits marketing mailing lists on a large scale using a novel blend of statistical text similarity and classification, enabling 100% coverage of data audits at 99% accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2020, I created a new member retention strategy that uses predictive analytics to identify customers who are most likely to churn based on factors related to product, price, experience, location, and socio-psychological characteristics. Using the top quantile of customers with the highest churn probability, the model offers a 700% increase in precision over random selection.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Though my primary focus is on solving business problems, I am passionate about discovering and utilizing modern technology to solve new problems and raise the standards of data science. In addition to my standard toolkit (R, SQL, Python, Git), I have successfully integrated AWS (SageMaker, Lambda, API Gateway), Docker, and Shiny into my everyday work routines.</p>
