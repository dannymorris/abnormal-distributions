      <description>AboutOriginal dataFeatures to engineerRPythonAboutFeature engineering is a central aspect of data science. It is often the case that data in its raw form is not immediately ready for discovery of insights, leading to the need for some degree of engineering.
In this article, we’ll look at a dataset of sales transactions containing a minimal amount of detail in its raw form. With an end goal in mind, we’ll engineer some features using R, Python, and SQL to compare these three tools.</description>

      <description>AboutInstall and load reticulateUsing conda environmentsInstalling Python librariesWriting Python code in R MarkdownAboutOne of my current goals is to gain basic familiarity with Python as a data science language. I’ve spent some time recently working with Pandas, seaborn, and sci-kit learn. I’ve had a pleasant experience working in the Spyder IDE. Still, nothing beats R Markdown for creating highly polished, reproducible documents and analyses.</description>
