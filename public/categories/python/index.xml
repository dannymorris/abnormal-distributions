      <description>PurposeEnvironmentCreate and activate conda environment in Anaconda PromptInstall dependenciesVery simple Flask appRun the appTest the appNext stepsPurposeDeploying production code is one of the toughest challenges that data scientists face. There seems to be significantly more content available on model development than model deployment. In this article, I document my experience building and deploying an web application written in Python using the Flask microframework.</description>

      <description>PurposeOriginal dataFeatures to engineerRPythonPurposeMoving from raw data to data that is prime for analysis is called feature engineering and it is a fundamental aspect of data science. Experienced data scientists will agree that feature engineering is an essential skill.
This article demonstrates the same engineering pipeline written in R and Python. The pipeline is not particularly complicated, though it resembles something that a data scientist would do.</description>

      <description>AboutInstall and load reticulateUsing conda environmentsInstalling Python librariesWriting Python code in R MarkdownAboutOne of my current goals is to gain basic familiarity with Python as a data science language. I’ve spent some time recently working with Pandas, seaborn, and sci-kit learn. I’ve had a pleasant experience working in the Spyder IDE. Still, nothing beats R Markdown for creating highly polished, reproducible documents and analyses.</description>
