      <description>Overview I recently participated in the M5 Forecasting - Accuracy Kaggle competition to forecast daily sales for over 30,000 WalMart products. I had some initial struggles processing the data and training models in-memory, so I eventually turned to running distributed training jobs using AWS SageMaker.
This post outlines the basic steps required to run a distributed machine learning job on AWS using the SageMaker SDK in Python. The steps are broken down into the following:</description>

      <description>OverviewCompetition overviewForecasting as a supervised machine learning problemGeneral feature engineeringModelsOne model per product using Random ForestsOne model per store using XGBoostModel performance with and without ensemblingSummary of my development and evaluation strategyPotential improvementsConclusionDisclaimer: The final competition leaderboard shows my score in the 46th percentile. I made a rookie mistake and failed to submit my (then) best model, which would have put my ranking in the top 28%.</description>

      <description>This post briefly describes how I built an object detection model using AWS SageMaker and GluonCV to detect Blue Cross Blue Shield logos. Full code and notebooks can be found in the GitHub repo.
Collecting and preparing training images To collect images for training, I searched Google for &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshied logo&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield letter&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield building&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield shirt&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield event&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield shirt&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield bus&amp;rdquo;. The logos in the images varied in size, shape, angle, clarity, and background.</description>
