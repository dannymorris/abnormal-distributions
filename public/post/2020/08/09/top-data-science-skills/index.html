<p>This short post lists three critical data science skills that I feel don’t receive enough attention. Do a quick Google search for “top data science skills” and you will find a lot of conversation around programming, statistics, machine learning, and data visualization. Like many, in the earlier stages of my career I focused solely on developing these technical skills. To be clear, these are important skills that data scientists should strive to possess (to varying degrees). Fortunately, they are learnable through structured study and progress is largely measureable.</p>
<p>However, I have learned that the core technical skills alone aren’t enough to make a great data scientist. For some context, I work in a business setting in which part of my responsibility is to optimize business problems using data science. I’ve been reflecting on my recent successes and failures, and I’ve identified some non-technical skills that are highly important to my success. They are much less concrete and much more difficult to measure, but combined with a solid technical foundation they have made me a better data scientist.</p>
<div id="dynamic-expansion-of-skills" class="section level2">
<h2>Dynamic expansion of skills</h2>
<p>In 2019, I saw a significant business optimization opportunity when I discovered that my company’s customer mailing lists routinely contained duplicate customer records that were not easily detectable. This was a recurring problem that was negatively affecting brand perception and customer experience. I knew a little about fuzzy string matching, but I didn’t have any practical experience. I did some research and learned that cosine similarity applied to tokenized text data was a fast and efficient approach for identifying highly similar customer records. After studying the literature and experimenting with code, I developed working knowledge of text tokenization, sparse matrices for text data, cosine similarity, and some Rcpp. I had the privelage of working on this problem with a great intern who helped me expand my management skills. After a few months of development, we released a highly successful internal application called SimText for fully automatic identification of duplicate customer records.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> There are always new things to learn, either out of necessity or curiosity. Being able to dynamically expand your skill set to deal with current challenges can greatly expand your opportunities and increase your value.</p>

<div id="persuasion" class="section level2">
<h2>Persuasion</h2>
<p>In a typical organization, there are always conflicts due to organizational politics and trust barriers. I recently worked on a project in which part of my responsibility was to improve a pre-existing model that was created by another department. Naturally, this created some political tension between our departments. Meanwhile, my team was working to gain trust from our new business partners by regularly demonstrating the objective benefits of our solution (automation, accuracy, user experience) without being critical of the pre-existing solution. Ultimately, my team proposed an innovative product that the business partners could not refuse.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Data scientistis are not immunue to organizational politics and trust issues. To persuade your customers, colleagures, and management and earn their trust, start by documenting and promoting the objective benefits of your solution. Blend this with kindness and sensitivity and your solution is much more likely to receive widespread acceptance.</p>
</div>
<div id="empathy" class="section level2">
<h2>Empathy</h2>
<p>When data scientists and business partners forge new relationships to solve a business problem, it can be painful at times. For the data scientist, a major challenge is taking a complex idea and translating it to a practical solution. When my intern and I developed the first version of SimText, I thought the UI was perfect. When we asked our business partners to test the application, they needed a lot of help navigating the UI to find the basic features. This served as a reminder that SimText was for them, not for us. Hearing their concerns, we redesigned the UI to provide a much improved user experience.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> At the end of the day, business partners want tools that are effective and easy to use. Data scientists desire the exact same thing. Having an empathetic mentality and understanding customer needs can go a long way towards building better products.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While tools, techniques, and technologies dominate the convsersation about the top data science skills, they are not enough to make a great data scientist. Knowning how to dynamically expand your skillset, persuade customers and colleagues, and demonstrate empathy can make data scientists more effective.</p>
