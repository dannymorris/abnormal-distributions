<p>This is the homepage and blog of Danny Morris. I currently work in the health insurance industry as a marketing analytics consultant for HealthNow New York, Inc. I&rsquo;ve been using the R language for about 5 years and I am very enthusiastic user of the language. My other main interests include exploratory data mining, machine learning, and visualization. I&rsquo;ve recently been exploring other data science technologies, including Python and SQL Server Machine Learning Services, to broaden my perspective. I became a data scientist the unconventional way. I don&rsquo;t have an advanced degree in mathematics or computer science. I learned a fair amount of statistics and R programming during my undergraduate years, but afterwards I continued to invest my time in learning the skills and technologies that I was passion about. Early on, that mainly involved principal components analysis, clustering, and visualization with ggplot2. Through my work, I began to apply the things I was learning and eventually developed some expertise in a few new subjects such as data engineering, machine learning, and writing good documentation. These days, I get a lot of joy out of helping new R users find their way with R and data science.</p>

<p>My website has two primary goals:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To <strong>document examples of my work.</strong></p></li>

<li><p>To <strong>document my experiences</strong> with data science techniques and technologies that impact my work and may do the same for others.</p></li>
</ol>
